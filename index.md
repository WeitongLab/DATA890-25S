## Overview
This graduate-level course is designed for students with interests in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and statistical methodologies. Advanced undergraduate students are also encouraged to enroll. Sequential decision-making systems, especially those powered by reinforcement learning, are essential for the development of autonomous AI systems and a core application of modern machine learning.The course covers foundational theories and concepts in decision-making algorithms, with a focus on reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. Key topics include the principles of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), Q-learning, and policy-based algorithms, along with hands-on analysis and exploration of their applications.
